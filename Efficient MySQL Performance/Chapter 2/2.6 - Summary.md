- Indexes provide the most and the best leverage for MySQL performance.
- Do not scale up hardware to improve performance until exhausting other options.
- Tuning MySQL is not necessary to improve performance with a reasonable configuration.
- An InnoDB table is a B-tree index organized by the primary key.
- MySQL accesses a table by index lookup, index scan, or full table scan—index lookup is the best access method.
- To use an index, a query must use a leftmost prefix of the index—the leftmost prefix requirement.
- MySQL uses an index to find rows matching WHERE, group rows for GROUP BY, sort rows for ORDER BY, avoid reading rows (covering index), and join tables.
- EXPLAIN prints a query execution plan (or EXPLAIN plan) that details how MySQL executes a query.
- Indexing requires thinking like MySQL to understand the query execution plan.
- Good indexes can lose effectiveness for a variety of reasons.
- MySQL uses three algorithms to join tables: NLJ, block nested-loop, and hash join.
