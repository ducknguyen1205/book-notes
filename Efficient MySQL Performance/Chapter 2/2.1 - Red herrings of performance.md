# Red Herrings of Performance

This section addresses why certain common approaches to improving MySQL performance can be misleading or inefficient.

- **Better, Faster Hardware!**
    
    - While MySQL can fully utilize all the hardware it's given, **hardware offers the least leverage for performance improvement**.
    - Simply increasing hardware (like RAM, CPUs, or storage IOPS) does not change how the application uses MySQL.
    - Scaling up hardware is only effective if the application workload itself can scale up, which is not always the case. This is why the book advises against starting performance optimization by "throwing hardware at the problem".
- **MySQL Tuning**
    
    - The author distinguishes three key terms often used interchangeably in MySQL literature:
        - **Tuning**: Involves adjusting MySQL system variables for research and development (R&D) purposes, often through benchmarking to expand knowledge about MySQL's limits. Results are typically not generally applicable.

        - **Configuring**: Setting system variables to appropriate values for the specific hardware and environment, usually done during initial provisioning or when significant data size changes occur (e.g., 10 GB to 100 GB). This influences how MySQL runs generally.
        - **Optimizing**: Improving MySQL performance by making the workload more efficient (e.g., reducing response time, increasing capacity) with existing hardware. This is the primary focus of the book.
    - **MySQL tuning is largely considered a "red herring" for performance** for two main reasons:
        - Results are often dubious if not done as a carefully controlled laboratory experiment, which is difficult given MySQL's complexity.
        - MySQL is already highly optimized, so tuning is "akin to squeezing blood from a turnip," meaning it's unlikely to yield significant performance gains.
    - As of MySQL 8.0, automatic configuration (e.g., `innodb_dedicated_server`) further reduces the need for manual configuration.

- **The book advocates for "optimizing" as the efficient use of an engineer's time**.
