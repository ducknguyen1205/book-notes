- **NewSQL**
    
    - **Definition**: NewSQL refers to a relational, ACID-compliant data store that includes **built-in support for scaling out**, meaning it's a SQL database that you theoretically don't have to shard yourself.
    - **Why MySQL is still popular**: Despite NewSQL's promise of built-in scaling, MySQL remains the most popular open-source database due to several factors.
    - **Five points explaining NewSQL's complexity/differences**:
        - **Maturity**: NewSQL solutions are exceptionally new, with major releases of TiDB and CockroachDB in 2017. The sources suggest caution in using them until at least 2027, given MySQL's long history of becoming mainstream after about 10 years.
        - **Familiarity**: Engineers are generally very familiar with MySQL, whereas NewSQL requires learning a new system.
        - **Complex operations**: Built-in scaling in NewSQL is achieved through distributed systems, which often entail multiple coordinated components. Managing these can be complex, especially if not fully managed by a service provider.
        - **Distributed system performance**: NewSQL performance is modeled by the Universal Scalability Law, where throughput is affected by load, concurrency, **contention (α)**, and **coherency (β)**. The presence of contention and coherency means that performance does not scale linearly and limits the database's overall performance.
        - **Performance characteristics**: The factors influencing query response time in MySQL (indexes, data, access patterns, hardware) can work differently in a distributed NewSQL system due to how data is stored and accessed. Some access patterns that are efficient in MySQL might be inefficient in NewSQL, and vice versa.
    - **Viable Open Source Solutions**: As of the time of writing the sources, the only two viable open-source NewSQL solutions that are MySQL-compatible are **TiDB** and **CockroachDB**.
    - **Disclaimer**: NewSQL is a promising technology to investigate as an alternative to sharding MySQL, but it is **not an effortless drop-in replacement**.

- **Middleware**
    
    - **Function**: Middleware solutions act between the application and the MySQL shards, aiming to **abstract or simplify the complexities of sharding**. They are considered when direct, manual sharding is too difficult and NewSQL is not feasible.
    - **Leading Open Source Solutions**:
        - **==ProxySQL==**: Functions as a proxy that supports sharding through various mechanisms. It's presented as a matter of personal preference, similar to choosing between Vim and Emacs.
        - **==Vitess==**: This is a **purpose-built MySQL sharding solution**. While it introduces its own complexity, its significant advantage is its ability to address all sharding challenges, including **resharding** and **rebalancing**. Vitess was developed by MySQL experts at YouTube, indicating a deep understanding of MySQL at massive scale.
    - **Consideration**: While middleware adds additional infrastructure to learn and maintain, its benefits can outweigh the significant engineering time, effort, and stress involved in manually sharding MySQL.

- **Microservices**
    
    - **Approach**: This alternative involves factoring out parts of a monolithic application into separate microservices. The core problem sharding addresses (too much data or access for one application) can sometimes stem from the application serving too many purposes or business functions.
    - **Benefits**: ==Using microservices is generally easier than sharding because the new microservice and its database are completely independent, eliminating the need for a shard key or strategy.== It can also allow the new microservice to have different access patterns, potentially using less hardware or even a non-relational data store better suited for its specific data needs.

- **Don't Use MySQL**
    
    - **Principle**: This alternative suggests that if another data store or technology is a better fit for the specific access patterns, then MySQL might not be the optimal choice.
    - **Application**: This is particularly relevant when designing a new application for sharding, as it offers the opportunity to evaluate other solutions from the outset. Even for migrating existing applications, considering the trade-offs of sharding MySQL versus migrating to a different solution is advised.
    - **Examples**: The sources mention that a relational database like MySQL is not the best choice for graph data (a graph data store would be better, or even a key-value store) or time series data (a time series database or columnar store would be more suitable).
